## Trello Card CLI
This Python script creates cards, assigns labels and adds comment from the command line to the specified list on trello board.

## Requirements
* Python3
* Trello API Key and Token(Can be generated at https://trello.com/power-ups/admin/new )
* Board ID (It can be found after clicking the board and adding '.json' at the end of the URL. The value we need is "id" at the start of JSON.)

## Usage
- Install the requirements using the command
   * pip install -r requirements.txt

- Run the script with any of the following commands with necessary arguements :
   * python Trello.py --key 'API KEY' --token 'TOKEN' --board_id 'id' --list_name "List Name" --card_name "Name" --labels Colour1 Colour2 --comment "Comment"
   * python Trello.py -k 'API KEY' -t 'TOKEN' -id 'id' -l "List Name" -n "Name" --labels colour1 colour2 -c "Comment"

- To avoid repetition and ensure security, itâ€™s ideal to store API keys and tokens in/as environment variables

## Error Handling
- Implements error handling for various issues faced during development
- Includes checks for API authentication, failed API requests, null credentials, incorrect list names and board IDs
- Takes care of edge cases such as missing parameters and irregular command arguments 

## Help
* Run `python Trello.py -h` to see the help message



## Future Development
I want to expand the Trello CLI tool to work more like 'kubectl' for Kubernetes.
